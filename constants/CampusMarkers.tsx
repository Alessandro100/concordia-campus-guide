The first phase began in 2003 to develop both the outdoor and indoor Loyola Campus recreation and athletics facilities. Artificial surfaces were installed to create two new outdoor playing fields for football, soccer, rugby, and recreational activities. Permanent lighting was installed to permit evening practices and games, and temporary stands were erected to replace badly deteriorating stadium seating. The Ed Meagher Arena lockers and rink refrigeration system were renovated in 2014. Fundraising is underway to extend and renovate other parts of the ageing 1967 Sports Complex.',

It has witnessed many changes. It has seen good times and hard times, student protests, rallies, debate, conflict, and intrigue. It has been the stress point when enrolment figures swelled and space was at a premium. The original abbreviated two-storey version of the Administration Building was inadequate soon after its 1916 opening, and additions to carry out the full original design of the building provided space for growing enrolment as soon as funds became available. The Central Building and the Chapel relieved the pressure somewhat in the 1930s and 1940s. In the early years Loyola had more junior (high school) students than college students, but by 1958-59 it was the reverse. After World War II the college enrolment figures jumped, and in 1957-58 a new extension program increased enrolment even further. By the 1960s every facility was bursting at the seams.',
