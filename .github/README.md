# Builds

- Builds are generated automatically when there is a change on the master branch.
- They're hosted [here](https://expo.io/@wltrf/NavConcordia/builds).
- Alternatively, if you don't want to install the app on your phone, you can emulate it in the expo app by scanning the QR code [here](https://expo.io/@wltrf/NavConcordia).

NOTE: It might take a while to see the new build appear as they are put in a queue. You can see the status of the queue [here](https://expo.io/turtle-status).
